                    <p>Peanut is a Jack Rusell/ Pinscher cross. Because of this she is very small and is often asked; "are you a puppy?", even though she is nearly eight years old. </p>

                <h3>Where is Peanut?</h3>
                <img src="images/close.jpg" alt="Peanut but Up Close">
                <p>Peanut lives in Clonmel with her owner's mother, as unfortunately she was not allowed to move with her owner to college since she now lives in a small apartment in Dublin with a "no dogs allowed" rule.</p>

                <h3>How is Peanut?</h3>

            <p>Peanut is often said since her owner is away during the week, but Peanut becomes very happy when her owner returns for the weekend to hang out with her. </p>

                <h3>Badger</h3>
                <p>Badger is a Jack Russell/ Lurcher cross. He now lives with Peanut's owner and Peanut is not happy about it, because it means she comes home at the weekend smelling like Badger. Peanut and Badger only see each other on major family holidays.</p>

                <h3>Nelly</h3>
                <p>Nellie is a Spaniel. She lives with Peanut's owner's uncle. Like Badger, Peanut and Nelly only meet on special occasions. Nelly is quite jealous of the fcat that Peanut is small enough to sit at the Christmas dinner table, whereas Nelly has not been able to since she was a puppy.</p>

                <h3>Holly</h3>
                <p>Holly is a Japanese Spitz. She lives with Peanut's owner's old childminder. Peanut and Holly only meet when her owner goes to visit while she is down from Dublin for the weekend. She isn't actually very fond of Peanut, but they get along sometimes.</p>

                <h3>Lara</h3>
                <p>Lara has never actually met Peanut, but she has a gr√° for her. Peanut however does not know or care for Lara, so it is a very one sided relationship. Lara also has an unrequited love for Badger. There are actually no dogs that like Lara. At all. Even her turtle doubts its' devotion from time to time.</p>
